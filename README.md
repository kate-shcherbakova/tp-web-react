In this TP we worked on a React project to create a beer list application. We started by setting up the project, including setting the necessary dependencies. There were some challenges with this. I provide a solution that may help with the module dependencies problem. 
1. Remove node_modules directory.
2. Remove package-lock.json file.
3. Install packages again with the command "npm install".

The next step was to create the components such as the BeerForm and modify the App entity. We then added functionality to add and remove beers from the list using state and props.

We also included routing in the project using React Router, which allowed users to navigate between the home page and the about page. 

Finally, we used Bootstrap to style the app and make it more visually appealing.

Running the project on your local machine:
1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the project dependencies by running the command "npm install".
4. Start the development server by running the command "npm start".
5. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
